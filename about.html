      This calculator is used to calculate the risk of a new prostate cancer
      recurrence within three years to select patients for randomization
      between receiving an addition of pelvic lymph node irradiation or not.

    <h1>About the study</h1>
    <p>
      The PROPER 2 calculator has been developed by the PROPER study group through
       prospective clinical trials on prostate salvage radiotherapy (SRT) in patients with
       biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Results from these studies demonstrate that the PSA response during SRT is 
       strongly associated with the risk of a new prostate cancer recurrence. We have 
       quantified the PSA response by a PSA decay-rate constant (<em>k<sub>PSA</sub></em>) using first order kinetics,
       i.e. -ln(<em>PSA</em>) ~ <em>k<sub>PSA</sub></em> x time (1). 
    </p>
    <p>
      We have shown that <em>k<sub>PSA</sub></em> together with prognostic clinical factors can predict treatment outcome with high accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calculator predicts the risk (P) of tumour recurrence within three years after SRT.
      It is determined with a logistic regression model including <em>k<sub>PSA</sub></em> (based on PSA
      response during the first four weeks of SRT), PSA at start of SRT, Gleason&nbsp;score,
      surgical resection margins and time between prostatectomy and SRT.  
    </p>
    <p>
      This calculator  is used in the prospective randomized phase III trial called PROPER 2
      for estimating the risk of a new prostate cancer recurrence within three years in 
      order to select patients for randomization between receiving an addition of pelvic
      lymph node irradiation or not.
